<hr />

<h3>Saving Private Ryan</h3>
<p>This is a great movie about second world war. One squad was instructed to find and save Private Ryan and they did.</p>

<h3>Hacksaw Ridge</h3>
<p>If you haven't noticed yet, I love watching war movies. Hacksaw Ridge is one of the best movies that I love. It shows the bravery of one soldier by saving his 70 wounded comrades in the midst of battle.</p>

<h3>The Patriot</h3>
<p>The movie is about the civil war in America and the main actor is Mel Gibson. It was an inspiring movie where at the end the black American slaves received their freedom from slavery. </p>
